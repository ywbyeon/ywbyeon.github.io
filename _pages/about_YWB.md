## Biography

Young-Woon Byeon is a group leader of the Advanced Electron Microscopy Group (`AEMG`) at Advanced Analysis and Data Center (`AADC`), KIST. He received his Ph.D. in `materials sciences and engineering` from `Korea University` (Seoul, Korea) in 2020 under the supervision of Dr. Jae-Pyoung Ahn and Prof. Jae-Chul Lee. During his doctorate courses, he studied the diffusion kinetics of lithium (Li<sup>+</sup>) and sodium (Na<sup>+</sup>) ions in alloying anodes (tin, silicon, antimony, etc.). By leveraging his in-situ/operando electron microscopy (EM) techniques, he revealed the mechanism how the diffusion of charge-carrier-ions was mitigated at the migrating interface during the volume expansion. After his Ph.D. courses, he joined `Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL)` as a post-doc research employee. Under the supervision of Dr. Haegyeom Kim and Dr. Peter Ercius, Young-Woon delved into the complexities of material properties per various processing. He investigated their implications in multiple applications, including all-solid-state batteries, proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC), and nanoporous ceramics. In November 2023, he started his new career in a tenure-track position as a senior research scientist at AADC KIST in Seoul, Korea.

## Research Interests

Dr. Byeon utilizes the `correlative analysis` capabilities of the Titan, Talos, and Tecnai transmission electron microscopes (`TEMs`) with the other analytical techniques (FIB, SEM, XRD, XPS, and APT). He also focus on the application of damage-less EM analysis techniques, such as `cryogenic TEM`, `low-acceleration voltage`, `utilizing direct electron detector`, etc. He also utilizes the high-resolution imaging capabilities coupled with in-situ TEM holders to study materials processes in various environments. His broad range of research interests include:

* Correlation study between performance degradation of battery material
* In situ / operando studies on the diffusion of charge-carrier (H+/Li+/Na+/K+, etc.) ions during reactions. 
* 4D-STEM analysis and spectrum processing for statistical analysis in a large area at materials interfaces. 
* Low e-beam dose / Cryo-EM techniques to minimize the sample damage during the observation. 
* STEM / FIB tomography of the environment sensitive materials and their data processing. 
* Machine Learning / Automation on the EM analysis process (Sample preparation, Transfer, Data acquisition, Data processing, Report)

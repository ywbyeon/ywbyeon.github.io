### Biography

Young-Woon Byeon is a group leader of the Advanced Electron Microscopy Group (`AEMG`) at Advanced Analysis and Data Center (`AADC`), `KIST`. He received his Ph.D. in `materials sciences and engineering` from `Korea University` (Seoul, Korea) in 2020 under the supervision of Dr. Jae-Pyoung Ahn and Prof. Jae-Chul Lee. During his doctorate courses, he studied the diffusion kinetics of lithium (Li<sup>+</sup>) and sodium (Na<sup>+</sup>) ions in alloying anodes (tin, silicon, antimony, etc.). By leveraging his in-situ/operando electron microscopy (EM) techniques, he revealed the mechanism how the diffusion of charge-carrier-ions was mitigated at the migrating interface during the volume expansion.

After his Ph.D. courses, he joined `Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL)` as a postdoctoral research employee. Under the supervision of Dr. Haegyeom Kim and Dr. Peter Ercius, Young-Woon delved into the complexities of material properties per various processing. He investigated their implications in multiple applications, including all-solid-state batteries (ASSB), proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC), and nanoporous bio-ceramics. In November 2023, Young-Woon started his new career in a tenure-track position as a senior research scientist at AADC, KIST in Seoul, Korea.

### Research Interests

Dr. Byeon utilizes the `correlative analysis` capabilities of the Titan, Talos, and Tecnai transmission electron microscopes (`TEMs`) with the other analytical techniques (FIB, SEM, XRD, XPS, and APT). He also focuses on the application of `damage-less TEM analysis techniques`, such as cryogenic TEM, low-acceleration voltage, utilizing direct electron detector, etc. He belives the TEM-based spectroscopy is the most powerful tool that can unravel the misteries in nano-scale worlds. He also utilizes the high-resolution imaging capabilities coupled with `in-situ/operando TEM` holders to study materials processes in various environments. His broad range of research interests include:

- Correlation study between performance degradation of battery material
- In situ / operando studies on the diffusion of charge-carrier (H<sup>+</sup>/Li<sup>+</sup>/Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>, etc.) ions during reactions.
- Diffraction and spectrum data processing for statistical analysis in a large area at materials interfaces.
- Low e-beam dose / Cryo-EM techniques to minimize the sample damage during the observation.
- STEM / FIB tomography of the environment sensitive materials and their data processing.
- Machine Learning / Automation on the EM analysis process (Sample prep./Transfer/Data acquisition/Data processing)

## <i class="fa-regular fa-face-smile-beam"></i>&nbsp;greetings!

Welcome to the official website of the Advanced Electron Microscopy Lab at KIST.

Led by Dr. Young-Woon Byeon, the lab specializes in advanced electron microscopy (EM) techniques—including imaging, diffraction, and spectroscopy—to explore the fundamental aspects of materials science. We collaborate with various research groups within KIST and beyond, harnessing the power of cutting-edge EM techniques.

Focusing on energy storage materials, we use real-time (in-situ and operando) analytics to trace atomic, ionic, and electronic movements with high precision. Our strategy integrates insights from the in-situation analysis in morphology, structure, and chemical properties obtained from various devices, including TEM, FIB, SEM, XRD, XPS, etc. This comprehensive understanding enables us to design and develop innovative, high-performance materials for energy storage applications.

## <i class="fa-regular fa-lightbulb"></i>&nbsp;research topics

The following research topics are the primary interests of the group:

- Correlating the performance degradation of battery materials with their microstructural evolution.
- In situ / operando studies on the diffusion of charge-carrier ions (H<sup>+</sup>/Li<sup>+</sup>/Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>, etc.) ions during electrochemical reactions.
- Processing and analyzing diffraction and spectrum data for statistical insights into materials interfaces.
- Utilizing STEM / FIB tomography for detailed analysis of environment-sensitive materials.
- Incorporating machine Learning / automation into the electron microscopy workflow, including sample preparation, data acquisition and processing.

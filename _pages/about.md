## <i class="fa-regular fa-face-smile-beam"></i>&nbsp;Greetings
Welcome to the official website of Dr. Young-Woon Byeon and the Advanced Electron Microscopy Group at KIST. 

Our research team is dedicated to advancing electron microscopy techniques—including Imaging, Diffraction, and Spectroscopy—to explore the fundamental aspects of materials science. By leveraging the expertise, we collaborate with numerous researching groups from the KIST and beyond. Our strategy integrates insights from the in-situation analysis in morphology, structure, and chemical properties obtained from various devices, including TEM, FIB, SEM, XRD, XPS, etc. This comprehensive understanding enables us to design and develop innovative, high-performance materials tailored for energy storage applications.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.

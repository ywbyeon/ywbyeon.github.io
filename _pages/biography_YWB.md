### Biography

Young-Woon Byeon is the group leader of the Advanced Electron Microscopy Laboratory (`AEML`) at the Advanced Analysis and Data Center (`AADC`), `KIST`. He earned his Ph.D. in `Materials Sciences and Engineering` from `Korea University` (Seoul, Korea) in 2020, where he studied under Dr. Jae-Pyoung Ahn and Prof. Jae-Chul Lee. During his doctoral research, he focused on the diffusion kinetics of lithium (Li<sup>+</sup>) and sodium (Na<sup>+</sup>) ions in alloying anodes such as tin (Sn), silicon (Si), antimony (Sb). Utilizing in-situ/operando electron microscopy techniques, he revealed how the diffusion of charge-carrier-ions was mitigated at the migrating interface during the volume expansion.

Following his Ph.D., he joined `Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL)` as a postdoctoral research employee, working with Dr. Haegyeom Kim and Dr. Peter Ercius. There, he explored the complexities of material properties under various processing conditions, with applications spanning all-solid-state batteries (ASSBs), proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC), and nanoporous bio-ceramics. In November 2023, Young-Woon began his tenure-track position as a senior research scientist at AADC, KIST in Seoul, Korea.

### Research Interests

Dr. Byeon utilizes the `correlative analysis` capabilities of the Titan, Talos, and Tecnai transmission electron microscopes (`TEMs`) alongside other analytical techniques such as FIB, SEM, XRD, XPS, and APT. He specializes in advanced `damage-less TEM analysis techniques`, including cryogenic TEM, low-acceleration voltage imaging, utilizing direct electron detector, etc. Believing TEM-based spectroscopy to be the most powerful tool for exploring nano-scale phenomena, he employs high-resolution imaging and `in-situ/operando TEM` holders to study materials processes in various environments. His research interests emcompass a broad range of topics, including:

- Correlating the performance degradation of battery materials with their microstructural evolution.
- In situ / operando studies on the diffusion of charge-carrier ions (H<sup>+</sup>/Li<sup>+</sup>/Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>, etc.) ions during electrochemical reactions.
- Processing and analyzing diffraction and spectrum data for statistical insights into materials interfaces.
- Appling low-dose electron beam and cryogenic techniques to minimize the sample damage during observation.
- Utilizing STEM / FIB tomography for detailed analysis of environment-sensitive materials.
- Incorporating machine Learning / automation into the electron microscopy workflow, including sample preparation, data acquisition, data processing.
